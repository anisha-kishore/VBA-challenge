# VBA-challenge
For this section, I have used 3 main sources: our class assignment, our TA Mark, and https://forum.ozgrid.com/forum/index.php?thread/87224-min-max-values-from-row-column-using-vba/.

For our class assignment, I used all the code from 'CardChecker_AdvancedCode.PNG' to help me define my variables, to go through rows, and to create the formulas/print each row for the stock_name and total_stock_volume columns.

Our TA Mark (I apologize, cannot find his last name) helped me with various lines of code, so I put a comment in the code above each line that he helped me with.

Finally, I used the link that I attached to create the code for all the code lines between "Greatest % Increase" and "Next ws".
